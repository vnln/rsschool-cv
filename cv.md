### About me

I've started learning Python and Javascript/Node.js when I was building a home automation project for myself.

Then I gradually moved into web development, frontend in particular (Javascript/Typescript/React/Next.js/TailwindCSS). I used to work full-time as a layout designer, develop user-scripts to speed up workflow and to automate Google Sheets.

I'm familiar with version control systems, project management systems (Jira). I also have experience with graphic editors. At the moment I have one deployed SPA-project on github.

I can understand other people's code. I feel confident in Linux environment, I'm not afraid of the command line interface. I've been learning English since my early childhood, my recent testing showed that I'm at the C2 level.
